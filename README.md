# MobileZone - Phone Selling Website

A simple, responsive phone selling website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is designed for a college assignment, focusing on clean design and responsiveness across all devices.

## Features

- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile
- Modern and clean UI
- Product showcase with hover effects
- Mobile-friendly navigation menu
- Smooth scrolling
- Interactive elements with JavaScript

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `styles.css` - CSS styling
- `script.js` - JavaScript functionality
- `images/` - Directory containing product images
  - `iphone16.png` - iPhone image
  - `samsung.png` - Samsung image (used for multiple phones in this demo)

## Images

The website uses local images stored in the `images` directory. For a production site, you might want to:
1. Add more high-quality images for each phone model
2. Optimize images for web (compress them)
3. Consider using a CDN for faster loading

## How to Run Locally

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

To host this website on GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Upload all files to the repository
3. Go to repository Settings â†’ Pages
4. Under "Source", select "main" branch
5. Click Save
6. Your site will be published at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Font Awesome for icons

## Notes

This is a frontend-only implementation, meaning the "Add to Cart" functionality does not actually store data. In a real-world scenario, this would be connected to a backend server.

## Compatibility

Tested and works on:
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Safari
- Mobile browsers
